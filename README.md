- 👋 Yo, I’m @jongler-dev aka Lior Amouyal 😃

- 👀 I’m interested in fullstack development, any type of rock/metal music and being the best dad I can be 💪

- 💻 I have so and so years of professional software engineering experience, my wife and kids say I have too much screen time 😆 
  I've been involved in many fullstack projects over the years, from early design stages all the way to deployment and support.

- 🌱 In my Github page you'll find some of the projects I have developed, my preferred tools and scripts, etc.

- 💞️ One project you would not find here is a product I implemented a while ago and it is still a work in progress, I keep updating it with cool new features.
**This project is a website scraper and a product tracker**, is scrapes a B2B e-commerce site ([heo.com](http://www.heo.com)) and updates the client's B2C e-commerce site with any product data in case it was changed.
You can see a preview of this project in the following repo: [heo-scraper-preview](https://github.com/jongler-dev/heo-scraper-preview).
